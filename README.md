I've been a Software Engineer since 2014, working at first in Java, then converted to Go in 2018. I've been a DevRel since 2021, which has given me the opportunity to speak at conferences and explore content creation.

You can read more about my background [on my blog](https://adelinasimion.dev/about_me/).

## Test-Driven Development in Go
My first book, ["Test-Driven Development in Go"](https://bit.ly/3UFpweU) was published in April 2023. 📙

It was a great journey to write it and I hope you enjoy it! 🌈 
I will do giveaways of the book often, so make sure to connect with me on the social media links [below](#keep-in-touch-with-me-💌).
